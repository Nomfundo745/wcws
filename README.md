IoT Based health monitoring system
Due to a rapidly aging population and the associated challenges in health and so-
cial care, ambient assistive living has become a focal point for both researchers and
industry. The need to manage or even reduce healthcare visits and costs while im-
proving service quality is high on government agendas. To address these issues, remote
real-time monitoring of a person’s health can be used to detect relapses in conditions,
allowing for early intervention. Thus, the focus of this project is the development of an
Internet of Things (IoT) health-based monitoring system capable of remotely observ-
ing elderly people. This project’s technology focuses on the ability to track a person’s
physiological data in order to detect specific disorders that can aid in early interven-
tion practices. This is accomplished by precisely processing and analyzing the acquired
sensory data via an IoT platform and transmitting the detection of a disorder to emer-
gency personnel. The obtained experimental results demonstrates that the proposed
system can improve clinical decision supports while also facilitating early intervention
practices. The extensive implementation results show that the proposed system has
superior performance in terms of low latency (a large number of packets are received
in a short period of time) and high reliability.
